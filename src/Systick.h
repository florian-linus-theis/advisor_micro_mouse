  /***
   * This is the SYSTICK ISR. It runs at 500Hz by default and is
   * called from the TIMER 2 interrupt (vector 7).
   *
   * All the time-critical control functions happen in here.
   *
   * interrupts are enabled at the start of the ISR so that encoder
   * counts are not lost.
   *
   * The last thing it does is to start the sensor reads so that they
   * will be ready to use next time around.
   *
   * Timing tests indicate that, with the robot at rest, the systick ISR
   * consumes about 10% of the available system bandwidth.
   *
   * With just a single profile active and moving, that increases to nearly 30%.
   * Two such active profiles increases it to about 35-40%.
   *
   * The reason that two profiles does not take up twice as much time is that
   * an active profile has a processing overhead even if there is no motion.
   *
   * Most of the load is due to that overhead. While the profile generates actual
   * motion, there is an additional load.
